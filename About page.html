                    <h2>History Of College</h2>
                    <p>Mount Seena College of Arts and Science is a self â€“financing college
                         affiliated to the University of Calicut. Envisioned by Mr.K.K.Mammunni Moulavi,
                          the Chairman of BSKT, the College has been imparting quality education and
                           climbing the ladder of academic excellence and social obligations since its
                            inception in 2010. Run under the BSKT,
                         a Public charitable trust, the college is home to
                          youngsters who hail from different cultural milieus.<br>
                              <br>
                        It was the long felt desire of Pathiripala town to have a full-fledged college 
                        to meet the rising demands of higher education. The number of higher secondary schools
                         in and around Pathiripala justified the claim for starting the college. The
                          resourcefulness and ardour of the BSKT transformed the dream into reality. 
                          The College was formally inaugurated by Mr.M.B.Rajesh, the honourable M.P of
                           Palakkad on 3rd July 2010 at a meeting presided over by Mr.K.K.Mammunni Moulavi,
                            the chairman of the BSKT. It was upgraded and shifted to the present site on 18 
                            July 2012 from its earlier site at the Mount Seena School premises. The present 
                            campus with its sprawling 14 acre land is situated in the Akalur Panchayat, near
                             Old Lakkidi.<br>
                             <br>
                        
                        Established with the goal of diffusing knowledge,
                         skills and learning to those on the fringes of the society, the college offers 7 UG
                          courses and 1 PG course spread across in Arts, Science and Commerce through 12
                           departments at present. In spite of being a fledgling in the field of higher education,
                            the college aims to transform the lives of young people who will change the world for
                             the better.</p>
